  description: `As an IT Manager, my focus is on empowering teams not just to overcome challenges, but to actively shape solutions. I lead cross-functional teams and drive IT and service projects that involve both technical and organizational change. For me, it’s essential that solutions don’t just look good on paper but are practical, effective, and sustainable in the real world.

I see myself as a facilitator and coach, enabling teams to collaborate effectively, share knowledge, and support each other. A core principle of my approach is assertive communication—clear, direct, yet respectful dialogue that provides both my teams and myself with clarity and direction. I strongly believe in fostering an open communication culture where every perspective is valued and well-informed decisions are made collectively.

A key part of my role is making complex topics understandable and aligning different interests toward a common goal. I bring together internal teams, external partners, and leadership to ensure smooth processes and well-founded decision-making. After all, successful projects aren’t just driven by technology—they thrive on strong collaboration. Decisions need to be not only strategically sound but also practical and executable.

For me, technology is not an end in itself but a tool to simplify workflows and create real value. IT should not complicate things—it should enable people to work efficiently and seamlessly.

I am committed to creating an environment where teams can grow, where challenges are approached openly, and where mistakes are seen as learning opportunities rather than failures. I firmly believe that the best solutions emerge when people can leverage their strengths—and I see it as my role to make that possible.

During project execution, my primary focus is on strict adherence to milestones and consideration of the three key elements: time, quality, and finances. A crucial pillar of my success lies in continuous and consistent risk management as well as transparent communication with workstream leads and diverse internal and external stakeholders. Due to the quality of my initial projects, I was quickly entrusted with the responsibility for international programs. An outstanding example of this is the successful implementation of a client from the financial sector in Hyderabad, India, and Dakar, Senegal – a task that was handled in three different languages (further information in the "Projects" section). In my role as a project manager, I employ a PMO methodology tailored specifically to the BPO industry, based on PRINCE2 and PMBOK.
